inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.\\n\\nour values\\n----------\\n\\nwe believe we can help build a future for everyone.\\n\\n\\nwe aim to be daring, but humble: we look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.\\nwe want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: we want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.\\nstay close to the real problems: we engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society\\'s challenges like those who live them every day.\\n\\nour success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other\\'s assumptions with fresh perspectives. to that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.\\n\\nthe opportunity\\n---------------\\n\\nthe ideal candidate will have a background in a
